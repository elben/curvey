        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Gaining an intuitive understanding for b-splines is difficult without
        directly seeing the effects of different knot vectors and control point
        positions.</p>

        <p>Curvey allows you to build b-spline curves by specifying the degree
        of the curve, control points, and the knot vector. This allows the user
        to see b-spline curves in its most general sense.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="background" class="section">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Many applications exist for playing around with
        b-splines, but they are all limited in one to all of the following
        ways:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>A fixed number of control points.</li>
          <li>Only uniform b-splines.</li>
          <li>No control of knot vector.</li>
          <li>Does not use polar notation.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Curvey uses the polar notation introduced by Lyle Ramshaw.</p>

        <h3>Polar Notation</h3>

        <p>This section introduces b-spline curves using the polar notation.
        We assume that you have a basic understanding of b-spline curves.</p>

        <p>A b-spline curve can be defined by a set of control points and a knot
        vector. Consider the example below:</p>

        <img src="resources/example1.png">

        <p>Here we have a cubic b-spline curve with five control points, <span
          class="code">(-4,-2), (-2,3), (3,4), (3,-2), (5,-3)</span> and knot
        vector <span class="code">[0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2]</span>. The control
        points are labeled with the control point number and with the
        <dfn>polar values</dfn>. For example, the control point at <span
          class="code">(3,4)</span> is the 3rd control point with polar values
        <span class="code">p(0, 1, 2)</span>.
        </p>

        <p>More formally, consider a degree <i>n</i> b-spline over the paramater
        interval <i>[a,b]</i>. We can give polar values to each control point using
        <i>n</i> consecutive knots from the knot vector</p>
        <p class="formula"><img src="resources/knotvector.png"></p>
        <p>Polar values are symmetric:</p>
        <p class="formula"><img src="resources/symmetric.png"></p>
        <p>And finally, we can calculate the (x,y) position of any polar value
        <i>c</i> that is between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>:</p>
        <p class="formula"><img src="resources/affine_combination.png"></p>
        <p>More in-depth discussion can be found in [1].</p>

        <h3>Knot Insertion &amp; de Boor</h3>

        <p>We can evalute the (x,y) values of a knot <i>t</i> between the
        paramater space <i>[a,b]</i> by inserting <i>t</i> into the knot vector
        such that there are <i>n</i> instances of <i>t</i> in the knot vector.</p>

        <p></p>

      <div id="curvey" class="section">

        <h2>Curvey</h2>

        <p>Curvey uses the de Boor algorithm to evaluate the b-spline curves. It
        uses a simple "walk" by inserting <span class="code">p(u,u,u)</span>
        every <i>delta</i> as defined by the
        user.</p>

        <h3>Setting Up</h3>

        <p>Download the latest stable version: <a
          href="https://github.com/eshira/curvey/archives/master">https://github.com/eshira/curvey/archives/master</a></p>

        <p>If you like living on the edge, you can download the latest git
        snapshot:</p>
        <div class="code">$ git clone git://github.com/eshira/curvey.git</div>

        <p>Curvey depends on Python an the Tkinter library, which is included in
        standard Python distributions. It has been tested on Python 2.6.</p>

        <h3>Using</h3>

        <p>To run the GUI version of Curvey, download the source and type:</p>
        <div class="code">$ python curvey.py --ui</div>

        <p>You can also give Curvey an input file:</p>
        <div class="code">$ python curvey.py file</div>

        <h3>Tutorial</h3>
        
        <p>This is a short tutorial on how to use the Curvey UI.</p>

        <p>We first run Curvey:</p>
        <div class="code">$ python curvey.py --ui</div>

        <p>Now, hit "Render". You should see something like:</p>
        <img class="full" src="resources/tutorial/2.png">

        <p>Note the left text panel. It contains:</p>
        <pre class="code">degree=3
dt=0.2
(1, 3)
(2, 4)
(6, 3)
(5, 1)
(2, 1)
(0, 2)
[0,0,0,1,3,4,4,4] </pre>
        <p>Curvey has rendered the curve specified.</p>

        <p>Press "Clear" to erase the canvas. Now, using your mouse, click on
        the canvas to create a control point. Hit "Render". You should get an
        error:</p>
        <img class="full" src="resources/tutorial/3.png">

        <p>This is because we don't have the right number of control points for
        the degree and knot vector specified.</p>

        <p><span class="important">Important</span> Curvey has two main methods
        of inserting control points. The first is through the text box. The
        second is by clicking on the canvas. When a control point is added via
        clicking, the text box control points become irrelevant and are
        ignored. Other information in the text box (e.g. dt, degree) are still
        used, however. To use the text box control points, you must erase all
        control points by hitting "Clear".</p> 

        <p>Add a total of six control points by clicking on points on the
        canvas. Hit "Render":</p>
        <img class="full" src="resources/tutorial/4.png">

        <p>You can render labels by clicking on the "Control point labels"
        checkbox and hitting "Render". The labels show the control point order
        and the control point's polar values:</p>
        <img class="full" src="resources/tutorial/5.png">

        <p><span class="important">Important</span> You can move a control point by right clicking on the control point
        you want to move. Place it anywhere on the canvas. You can delete a
        control point by double clicking on the control point.</p>

        <p>Curvey was designed to support complex b-spline specifications. Here
        is an example of a 4 degree spline with 11 control points:</p>

        <h3>Limitations and Known Bugs</h3>

        <p><b>Not working on OS X 10.6 using Python 2.7</b>. There are screwed up
        dependencies with OS X 10.6 and Tk, so Python 2.7 64bit does not come with Tk.
        Use Python 2.7 32bit instead:</p>
        <div class="code">$ python2.7-32 curvey.py --ui</div>
