        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Gaining an intuitive understanding for b-splines is difficult without
        directly seeing the effects of different knot vectors and control point
        positions.</p>
        <p>Curvey is a b-spline demo that allows the user to specify the degree
        of the spline, the number of control points, and the knot vector.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Many applications exist for playing around with
        b-splines, but they are all limited in one to all of the following
        ways:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>A fixed number of control points.</li>
          <li>Only uniform b-splines.</li>
          <li>No control of knot vector.</li>
          <li>Does not use polar notation.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Curvey uses the polar notation introduced by Lyle Ramshaw.</p>

        <h3>Polar Notation</h3>

        <p>This section introduces b-spline curves using the polar notation.
        We assume that you have a basic understanding of b-spline cruves.</p>

        <p>A b-spline curve can be defined by a set of control points and a knot
        vector. Consider the example below:</p>

        <img src="resources/example1.png">

        <p>Here we have a cubic b-spline curve with five control points, <span
          class="code">(-4,-2), (-2,3), (3,4), (3,-2), (5,-3)</span> and knot
        vector <span class="code">[0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2]</span>. The control
        points are labeled with the control point number and with the polar
        points. For example, the control point at (3, 4) is the 3rd control
        point with polar points (0, 1, 2).

        <h3>Installing</h3>
        <p>Curvey depends on Python. It has been tested on Python 2.6. To run
        the GUI version of Curvey, download the source and type:</p>
        <div class="code">$ python curvey.py --ui</div>

        <p>You can also give Curvey an input file:</p>
        <div class="source">$ python curvey.py file</div>

        <h3>Using</h3>
