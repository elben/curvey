        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Gaining an intuitive understanding for b-splines is difficult without
        directly seeing the effects of different knot vectors and control point
        positions.</p>

        <p>Curvey allows you to build b-spline curves by specifying the degree
        of the curve, control points, and the knot vector. This allows the user
        to see b-spline curves in its most general sense.</p>

      <div id="background" class="section">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Many applications exist for playing around with
        b-splines, but they are all limited in one to all of the following
        ways:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>A fixed number of control points.</li>
          <li>Only uniform b-splines.</li>
          <li>No control of knot vector.</li>
          <li>Does not use polar notation.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Curvey uses the polar notation introduced by Lyle Ramshaw.</p>

        <h3>Polar Notation</h3>

        <p>This section introduces b-spline curves using the polar notation.
        We assume that you have a basic understanding of b-spline cruves.</p>

        <p>A b-spline curve can be defined by a set of control points and a knot
        vector. Consider the example below:</p>

        <img src="resources/example1.png">

        <p>Here we have a cubic b-spline curve with five control points, <span
          class="code">(-4,-2), (-2,3), (3,4), (3,-2), (5,-3)</span> and knot
        vector <span class="code">[0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2]</span>. The control
        points are labeled with the control point number and with the
        <dfn>polar values</dfn>. For example, the control point at <span
          class="code">(3,4)</span> is the 3rd control point with polar values
        <span class="code">p(0, 1, 2)</span>.
        </p>

        <p>More formally, consider a degree <i>n</i> b-spline over the paramater
        interval [a,b]. We can give polar values to each control point using n
        consecutive knots from the knot vector</p>
        <p class="formula"><img src="resources/knotvector.png"></p>
        <p>Polar values are symmetric:</p>
        <p class="formula"><img src="resources/symmetric.png"></p>
        <p>And finally, we can calculate the (x,y) position of any polar value
        <i>c</i> that is between a and b:</p>
        <p class="formula"><img src="resources/affine_combination.png"></p>

        <h2>Curvey</h2>

        <p>Curvey uses the de Boor algorithm to evaluate the b-spline curves. It
        uses a simple "walk" by inserting p(u,u,u) every delta as defined by the
        user.</p>

        <h3>Setting Up</h3>

        <p>Download the latest stable version: <a
          href="https://github.com/eshira/codewithus/archives/master">https://github.com/eshira/codewithus/archives/master</a></p>

        <p>If you like living on the edge, you can download the latest git
        snapshot:</p>
        <div class="code">$ git clone git://github.com/eshira/curvey.git</div>

        <p>Curvey depends on Python an the Tkinter library, which is included in
        standard Python distributions. It has been tested on Python 2.6.</p>

        <h3>Using</h3>

        <p>To run the GUI version of Curvey, download the source and type:</p>
        <div class="code">$ python curvey.py --ui</div>

        <p>You can also give Curvey an input file:</p>
        <div class="code">$ python curvey.py file</div>

        <h3>Limitations and Known Bugs</h3>

        <p><b>Not working on OS X 10.6 using Python 2.7</b>. There are screwed up
        dependencies with OS X 10.6 and Tk, so Python 2.7 64bit does not come with Tk.
        Use Python 2.7 32bit instead:</p>
        <div class="code">$ python2.7-32 curvey.py --ui</div>
